### Exec

Format: `-exec <command> <terminator>`

- **`{}`:** Is replaced by the current file name being processed. It doesn't have to be quoted (`"{}"`).
- **`\;`:** As `;` has a meaning for the shell, it must be escaped for `find` to get it.

**`\;` vs. `+`:**

- With `;`, the command is executed on each matched item.

    Command: `find . -type f -exec echo {} \; | wc -l`  
    Similar to: `echo 1; echo 2; echo 3`  
    Result: `3`

- With `+`, the command is executed once with the list of all the matched items.

    Command: `find . -type f -exec echo {} + | wc -l`  
    Similar to: `echo 1 2 3`  
    Result: `1`
